# Election Management System (Java Swing)

## Overview
This is a **Java Swing–based Election Management System** developed as a
**college Semester 3 project**.  
The project integrates a **backend layer using Java and JDBC** to manage
election-related operations and demonstrates a complete **UI + backend flow**.

## Project Scope
- Java Swing UI for user interaction
- Backend logic for election workflow
- Database integration via JDBC
- **Sensitive database credentials are removed** from the source code

## UI Note
The application uses a **basic Swing UI**, as it was created during an
early academic learning phase. The main focus was on understanding
**application flow, event handling, and backend integration** rather than
advanced UI styling.

## Features
- User authentication
- Candidate and voter handling
- Secure voting process
- Vote counting and result display
- UI-to-backend interaction using JDBC

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Swing
- JDBC
- MySQL (or relational database)

## Security Note
Database connection logic is present, but **credentials are not hardcoded**.
They are expected to be provided through configuration files or environment
variables during runtime.

## Academic Context
- College Project
- Semester: **SEM 3**
- Objective: Learning **Java Swing**, **backend integration**, and
  **database-driven application design**

## Note
This project is intended for **educational purposes** and demonstrates
foundational concepts of Java desktop application development.
