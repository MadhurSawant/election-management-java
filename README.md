# Election Management System (Java Swing)

## Overview
This is a **Java-based Election Management System** developed as a
**college Semester 3 project**.  
Both the **UI and backend are implemented entirely in Java**, using
**Swing for the user interface** and **JDBC for backend integration**.

## Project Scope
- UI built using **Java Swing**
- Backend logic implemented in **Core Java**
- Database interaction handled via **JDBC**
- Sensitive database credentials have been **removed from the source code**

## UI Note
The application uses a **basic Swing UI**, as it was developed during an
early academic learning phase. The primary focus was on understanding
**Java fundamentals, event handling, and UI–backend interaction** rather
than advanced UI design or theming.

## Features
- User authentication
- Candidate and voter management
- Secure voting workflow
- Vote counting and result display
- Java-based UI communicating with backend logic

## Tech Stack
- Java (UI + Backend)
- Swing
- JDBC
- MySQL (or relational database)

## Security Note
Database connection logic exists, but **credentials are not hardcoded**.
They are expected to be provided through configuration files or
environment variables during runtime.

## Academic Context
- College Project
- Semester: **SEM 3**
- Objective: Learning **Java Swing**, **backend integration**, and
  **database-driven application development**

## Note
This project is intended for **educational purposes** and demonstrates
foundational Java desktop application concepts.
